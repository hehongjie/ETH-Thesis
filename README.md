# Instance Segmentation of Geometrical Shapes in Aerial Images
This is my Master thesis project at ETH Zurich, which contains two parts:
* Buildings Segmentation (see `buildings/Train.py`),
* Roads Segmentation (see `roads_polygon_new/Train.py`).

Data should be placed correctly in the folder `data`.
If you want the data please send me an request email.

Arguments:
`--city`: the city name.
`--net`: backbone of the net.
`--load`: resume training or not.
